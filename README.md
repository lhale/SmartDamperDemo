# SmartDamperDemo
This demo is an Angular+Angular UI Bootstrap+ng-table rewrite that simulates control of a collection of HVAC dampers found on a building's 10th floor.
Clicking on a damper drills down to that damper and allows the user to adjust the CFM for the selected damper.
A quick click on the Floor Controller link gets back to the previous floor view that shows the CFM change
